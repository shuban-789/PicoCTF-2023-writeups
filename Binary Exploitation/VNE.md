# PicoCTF 2023 Binary Exploitation: VNE - 200 points 

## Background 
PicoCTF is an annual cybersecurity competition held by professionals from Carnegie Mellon University which challenges competitors’ problem solving skills with various tasks with the objective to obtain a flag to get points. Each task has a slight description, followed with an instance button or a file. With the goal in mind of getting the flag, the competitor must exploit computer related vulnerabilities to extract the flag even though it may seem impossible at first in some cases.

## VNE Intro 
Scenario, tags, important info:

In PicoCTF, taking hints are not harmful to your point count and thus should be treated just like normal information.

### Takeaways from hints, description, and tags: 
* Something important is in the /root file (the flag)
* We will have to use environment variables
* The binary lists contents of a directory as root
* We need to inject code into “ls”

## Phase 1: Recon 
It is important to get familiar with the machine we log into so that we can find important assets such as possible vulnerabilities, which we may be able to exploit to get us root access

### What do we notice? 
* A binary that lists a directory as root
* Why this is important: It does it as root via an SUID bit
* How it works: It takes the input for the directory as an environment variable
* Other important takeaways: If it is listing the contents of a directory, it is most probably doing something with the ls binary

### What do we know based on the descriptions,  tags, and hints? ###
* Environment variables will be a key part of our exploitation strategy
* It is confirmed that the ls binary will have to be manipulated
* Flag is in the root directory
* One of the tags say injection, so we may be able to try environment variable injection

## Phase 2: Constructing a Plan 
Using the information we have gathered, we can try to assess vulnerabilities on our target system. So far, we have thought of environment variable injection, but now it is time for us to plot out this plan.

### The Plan™: 
We make our own ls binary that spawns a shell. If this binary with an SUID bit on it will run the normal ls binary as root, running our version should spawn a root shell. There is however, a rather huge obstacle. How would we execute this plan so that the binary we are manipulating thinks our ls binary is the real ls binary?

Our friend here would be the PATH environment variable. And if you did not instantly come to this conclusion, you could have used Google.

### The Theory: 
Since we put /tmp before all the other directories, it should execute our ls binary instead of the real ls binary

## Phase 3: Execution 🧀
First, let's log onto our machine. To logon, we will need to use ssh with the command format of: 
`ssh -p <port> <user>@<ip>`
After logging on, let’s list our environment variables.

Next, lets inject our /tmp directory into PATH

Finally, we need to make our fake ls binary containing this C code:
```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main()
{
  system("/bin/bash");
}
```

Lets execute!
